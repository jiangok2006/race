# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

Print routes for debug:
```
npx remix routes
```

# Learning
1. [remix-flat-routes](https://github.com/kiliman/remix-flat-routes) uses remix.config.js. This project
uses vite.config.ts which needs simple translation.

2. `npm run dev` can hot reload.
